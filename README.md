The application displays a work in progress portfolio that incorporates a small bio, projects, and a list of images providing the "contact me" section.
The navigation bar is linked to each section of the application and will navigate you to the according section.
Furthermore, the about section provides some background information of myself.
The Projects section is provided with a "Click me" button that dynamically populates the projects I have created and will continue to create throughout the bootcamp.
Finally, the footer is designed with images that are linked to my social media handles (currently only linked to my github).

Future development: I plan on continously updating and revamping this application throughout the bootcamp as my expertise and toolbox grows. I would love to link seperate pages to the portfolio and expand the capabilities of this application. Adding a resume is also in the works, I'm really excited to see what I can create.
